# Multitool-C-Sharp
A simple multitool that can run 10 different and unique processes to get information, help the user, and to troll.

this only works on windows, works on windows 11. Older versions of windows have not been tested so try at your will.
nothing in the script can damage or infect your computer with malware, though it can do certain processes that can make you PC crash similar to malware just without any lasting damage.

There will most likely be no updates to this repository but if so just use the same process in this text doc or just paste the new code.

THIS IS THE PROCESS FOR DOING THE STEPS MANUALLY BUT THERE WILL BE A PRE BUILT .EXE THAT WILL WORK WITHOUT ALL OF THIS

Step 1:

Download Microsoft Visual Studio "https://visualstudio.microsoft.com"

Step 2:

Create a new project, go to the categories and make the language C# and the project type console. You will see 2 options, "Console App" and "Console App (.NET Framework)" make sure your application is the second one.

Step 3:

Paste the script from the other file located in this repository. Then go to tools at the top and go down till you see NuGet Package Manager, click manage then search for Newtonsoft.Json and then install.

step 4:

Click Start and you are now you are running the MultiTool.
